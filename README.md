You must move beyond your samurai traditions to forge a new way of fighting -- the way of the Ghost -- as you wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Japan.",

The stealth elements are not the strongest, and aside from the missions requiring stealth, I almost always took the more forward approach to combat, but the freedom to DO that is part of what makes the game so good. Sony has consistently released incredible, single player, story focused exclusives for the PS4, and Ghost of Tsushima stands tall as one of their best yet.",
